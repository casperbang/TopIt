TopIt
=====

Among other things, TopIt allows you to control the Z-order of all applications, like on Linux.

These features are to be considered stable and tested:

* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Z&gt; Toggles the "always on top" Z-order lock of a window
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;X&gt; Completely hides the window temporarily (until combo hit again)
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;C&gt; Toggles the re-sizable/movable border of a window on/off
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num Plus&gt; Increases opacity (removes transparency) of a window
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num Minus&gt; Decreases opacity (adds transparency) of a window

The following features are tested but somewhat experimental:

* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num 5&gt; Tries to expand window to take as much desktop space as available
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num 2&gt; Selects bottom edge of window for manipulation
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num 8&gt; Selects top edge of window for manipulation
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num 4&gt; Selects left edge of window for manipulation
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num 6&gt; Selects right edge of window for manipulation

These features are highly experimental and may or may not work:

* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num 7&gt; Selects  top-left edges of window for manipulation
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num 9&gt; Selects  top-right edges of window for manipulation
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num 1&gt; Selects  lower-left edges of window for manipulation
* &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Num 3&gt; Selects  lower-right edges of window for manipulation

Remember, this is an initial code drop and therefore work in progress. You may read more about it on my blog at http://blog.bangbits.com
