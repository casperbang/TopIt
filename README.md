TopIt
=====

Among other things, TopIt allows you to control the Z-order of all applications, like on Linux.

These features are to be considered stable and tested:

<Alt>+<Z> Toggles the "always on top" Z-order lock of a window
<Alt>+<X> Completely hides the window temporarily (until combo hit again)
<Alt>+<C> Toggles the re-sizable/movable border of a window on/off
<Alt>+<Num Plus> Increases opacity (removes transparency) of a window
<Alt>+<Num Minus> Decreases opacity (adds transparency) of a window

The following features are tested but somewhat experimental:

<Alt>+<Num 5> Tries to expand window to take as much desktop space as available
<Alt>+<Num 2> Selects bottom edge of window for manipulation
<Alt>+<Num 8> Selects top edge of window for manipulation
<Alt>+<Num 4> Selects left edge of window for manipulation
<Alt>+<Num 6> Selects right edge of window for manipulation

These features are highly experimental and may or may not work:

<Alt>+<Num 7> Selects  top-left edges of window for manipulation
<Alt>+<Num 9> Selects  top-right edges of window for manipulation
<Alt>+<Num 1> Selects  lower-left edges of window for manipulation
<Alt>+<Num 3> Selects  lower-right edges of window for manipulation
